A customer writes in saying their “site won’t build”.  Compose your best short (2-paragraph) customer-facing answer without any additional data, that could be useful in the generic case but would also lead to a customer providing a more actionable response.

Hi INSERTNAMEHERE,

I am so sorry that the product is not working as intended. I want to first thank you for taking the time to reach out to Support. Rather than giving up on us, I appreciate that you contacted us. Our team is working every day to make the building process easier and more automated. Your feedback will help me identify the issue and prevent the problem from happening in the future.

I will be reviewing our server logs for error that can help us identify the issue. Since each build is unique, I'd like you to review the files in your site repo and help us find any strange errors or configuration that may contribute to the build failure. I will contact you as soon as I have more information. Thank you so much for helping us.
