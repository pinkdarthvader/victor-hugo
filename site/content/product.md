### What did you think of our service during the time you used it?  

The product is very easy to use. The interface is intuitive. There are so many ways to deploy. Netifly one click deploying tool is by far the best way to launch the site.


### Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.  Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.

I tinkered with the tool and some of the static generators. I choose Hugo because I've heard of Jerkyll and I have been playing with this static generator for a personal project. I wanted to try something different.

I started with one-click deployment tool. I realized that this hindered my ability to understand how Hugo content hierarchy functioned. I reviewed the documentation and tested a Hugo generator on a different repo. I ran a manual deployment and failed. It looks like some of the necessary logs were missing in the forked project. It was quite frustration but I had a better understand of how the Hugo created content.

I returned to the main victor-hugo project and corrected my errors.


### Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?

I personally would like more guidance on which static generators to use. I am certain there are common mistakes or missed steps that developers run into depending on the build. I found it challenging because I've never deployed a site on Git. I've simply maintained sites. I know that I've fallen behind on many new frameworks of development.
