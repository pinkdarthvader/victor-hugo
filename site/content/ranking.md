## Favorite things to do

Favorite things to do ranked from 1-5. 1 being the best. I found it really hard to pick because I remember doing all of this in my previous job and found tasks interesting and boring depending on the situation.

1. Help train and onboard new support teammates
2. Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before
3. Work with people to figure out if Netlify's service can solve a particular workflow or integration challenge they have
4. Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup
5. Help manage communications during a service outage


## Least Favorite

1. Respond to 60+ support requests via email or chat every day. (I believe in quality not quantity.)
2. Work with prospective customers to explain our service and the pricing model
3. Find and recruit teammates for the support team
4. Submit bug reports and potentially bug fixes to closed and open source projects that Netlify maintains on GitHub
5. Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product

### What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?
My favorite thing about technical support is empowering and watching people grow and learn thing that they did not think is possible. I believe that education is the center of Support.
